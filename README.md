# cosmos-validators

The goal of this project is to set a graphical interface to the selection and voting process of the validator nodes.
This is developped on Cosmos, with Istanbul consensus. It works as a Dapp, no backend exists on this application and it
relies on direct interaction with the Blockchain.

We designed the frontend in a simple way, just so to allow developpers to use it to develop upon Cosmos.

We have used the following technologies :
- frontend : html/css, jquery, ajax, jsonrpc (no web3)
